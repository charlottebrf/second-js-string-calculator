## Getting Started

```
npm install
```

## Running Tests

```
jasmine
```

## Test suite

```
Jasmine
```

## My Approach
I aimed at all times to do the smallest possible thing & to write the kata in a TDD way. I followed a Red, Green, Refactor cycle.

I installed lodash as a dependency to use a wider variety of enumerators, rather than repetitive for loops.

## Future Improvements
For the next version of the String Calculator I'd like to make the following improvements:
- Be more accurate in my use of delimeters & regex - so each number is separated by its the specific character next to its number
- Have all of my syntax using ES6 syntax
